## PrivMX Endpoint
Programming library used by applications and devices which are the ends of PrivMX secure communication channels. It encrypts and decrypts data, manages network connections and provides a functional API, allowing the applications to build their E2EE communication channels based on a few universal, client-side encrypted tools: Threads, Stores, and Inboxes.

PrivMX Endpoint is a modular, low-level library written in C++, ready to be configured and used on any device (including IoT, VR + more) and any operating system.

Full PrivMX documentation, PrivMX Endpoint API, "Getting Started" and installation quides can be found in our [Documentation](https://docs.privmx.dev/docs/latest/cpp/introduction).
